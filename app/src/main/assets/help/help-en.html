<h2>Overview</h2>

This app takes direct and diffuse radiation data from Open-Meteo.com, calculates the position
of the sun and projects the radiation on your solar panel.
It shows the estimated energy production for the next hours and up to 16 days.
The hourly values are calculated for the preceding hour.
So if there are 150 Wh shown at 11:00 this means you can expect 150 Wh between 10:00 and 11:00.

<h2>Parameters</h2>

<h3>Latitude [°]</h3>
Latitude specifies the north–south position of your solar power plant. It ranges from –90° at the south pole to 90° at the north pole.

<h3>Longitude [°]</h3>
Longitude specifies the east–west position of your solar power plant. The prime meridian defines 0° longitude. Positive longitudes are east of the prime meridian, negative ones are west.

<h3>Azimuth [°]</h3>
Azimuth is the horizontal direction of your solar power plant. 0° equals North, 90° equals East, 180° equals South, 270° equals West.

<h3>Tilt [°]</h3>
Tilt is the vertical direction of your solar power plant. 0° means it points up towards the the sky, 90° means it has a vertical orientation and points towards the horizon.

<h3>Cells max power [W]</h3>
Maximum power your solar cells can deliver.

<h3>Cells efficiency  [%]</h3>
Portion of energy in the form of sunlight that can be converted into electricity by the solar cell.

<h3>Cell area [m<sup>2</sup>]</h3>
Size of the active area your solar panel.

<h3>Diffuse radiation efficiency  [%]</h3>
Efficiency of your solar power plant for diffuse radiation. When pointing up it should be around 100%, when pointing to the horizon it may be around 50%.
Also depends on reflections etc.

<h3>Inverter power  [W]</h3>
Maximum power of your inverter. If it is lower than the maximum power of your panels the output power of your system will be limited by this parameter.

<h3>Inverter efficiency  [%]</h3>
Efficiency of your inverter.

<h3>Shading</h3>
In this section you can define the shading on your solar panels.
For each azimuth angle range, you can specify the minimum elevation of the sun that is necessary for the sun to hit the solar panels.
For elevations below this value you can set the percentage of shading. For example, a building will reduce radiation by 100%, a tree maybe only by 60%.
