# Solar Panel Optimizer Web App

A modern web application for calculating optimal solar panel angles and analyzing historical solar energy production.

## Features

### ðŸŽ¯ Optimal Angles Calculator
- Calculates optimal azimuth (compass direction) and tilt angles based on location
- Provides visual representations of panel orientation
- Shows required panel area based on system size and efficiency
- Includes location-specific recommendations

### ðŸ“Š Historical Analysis
- Fetches one year of historical weather data
- Calculates hourly power production
- Provides comprehensive visualizations:
  - Monthly production bar chart
  - Daily production heatmap
  - Key performance metrics
- Export data in Excel or CSV format

## Running the App

1. **Start the web app:**
   ```bash
   ./run_web_app.sh
   ```

2. **Open your browser:**
   Navigate to `http://localhost:8501`

## Using the App

### Input Parameters (Sidebar)
- **Location**: Enter latitude and longitude in decimal degrees
